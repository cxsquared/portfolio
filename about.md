<h3>Programmer/Composer</h3>
Hi! My name is Cody Claborn and I'm currently a student at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). I'm studying Music Technology with a focus in Media Arts and Science and more specifically game design and development. My other pasion, besides music, is programming. In my free time I'm constantly designing and programming games.

I'm heavily involved with the game development community at IUPUI. I help run the [Game Developers Group](http://www.indiana.edu/~gamedev/) on campus. On top of my involvment with students groups I've also been fortunate to take part in a class that created and showed off an alternate reality game called [Return of Aetheria](http://returnofaetheria.org/) at an Indianpolis convention [Indy PopCon](https://indypopcon.com/).

If you have any questions or want to request more information you can [Contact Me on my site]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).
