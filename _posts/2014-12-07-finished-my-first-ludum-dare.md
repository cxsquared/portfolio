I&#8217;ve finally finished my first ever Ludum Dare! I&#8217;m really happy with how it turned out. Down the Rabbit Hole is a simple platformer that uses the previous levels as the tiles for the next level. It&#8217;s pretty basic but I&#8217;m happy with how it all came together. The game was made using <a href="haxeflixel.com/" target="_blank">Haxeflixel</a>, <a href="http://pyxeledit.com/" target="_blank">PyxelEdit</a> for graphics, and Logic for music.
