#### My entry for the Ludum Dare 33 compo. The theme was You are the Monster.

I had no plans on doing this jam but really liked the theme and ended up making a game I'm pretty happy with.

Sound control puts you in the role of controlling people using sound. Adjust the sound to make people do all kinds of crazy things.
From raving to zombies, sound can be a powerful tool. Make sure your citizens stay happy and health and see how many you can control at one time.
Or just see how fast you can kill them!!

The power is in your hands, will you be the monster?
