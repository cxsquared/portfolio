Fireflies was a game built in 1 hour during the [0 Hour Game Jame](0hgame.eu). I just wanted to see what I could do in one hour and make a really quick prototype. The game is a simple avoidence game built with [Haxeflixel](http://haxeflixel.com/). You can play it by clicking read more or view the source over on my [Github](https://github.com/cxsquared/Firefly-0hgame)!

### Original

This was the orginal game that was built in just 1 hour.

{% swfobject /dev/assets/games/0hgame-old.swf height:600px width:800px %}<img src="/dev/assets/ogfire.png">{% endswfobject %}

### Improved

I spent an hour to improve the graphics just to experiement a bit.

<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/dev/assets/games/0hgame.swf" width=800 height=600>
<param name="movie" value="games/0hgame.swf">
<param name="quality" value="high">
<img src="/dev/assets/firefly.png">
</object>

The experience was fun and quite silly to try and create anything working in an 1 hour at 2 in the morning.
