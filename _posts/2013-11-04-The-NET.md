The NET is the second game I ever created. It's my take on a side scrolling bullet hell game with a branching story line. The game itself is very mediocre but has a decent story and a dynamic soundtrack. The game was made with Flash and AS3. You can play it over on [Newgrounds.com](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/627759).

The story for the game was ment to be symbolic for addiciton. The branching storyline had many choices but was pourly implemented. I did like the dynamic soundtrack I made that backed-up the choices you made in the game.
